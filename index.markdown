# About
---
Iâ€™m Dietrich Geisler, a 5th year PhD student in Computer Science at Cornell University.
I work with the (Capra research group)[https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/] led by (Adrian Sampson)[https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/research.html].
My research goals are focused on the development of (Domain Specific Languages)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language], with an emphasis on helping the programmer more easily write readable and correct programs.</p>

My current research is on developing the (Gator)[https://github.com/cucapra/gator] language for geometric programming.
Gator is designed to help Graphics programmers reason about the geometry of the program through annotations and compiler typechecking.
The primary contribution of Gator is the introduction of a type structure around *Reference Frames*, an idea rooted in (geometry)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference"].
